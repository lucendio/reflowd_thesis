abstract: >
    Often data are referred to as *the oil of the 21st century*. But recovering petroleum or coal is
    governed by rules and legislation, whereas vast amounts of personal data are harvested
    from a variety of resources with no working restrictions or asking for permission. Well
    air-conditioned data centers are mining these data around the clock via dozens of CPUs, eager to discover
    even the tiniest correlations worth interpreting in enormous haystacks that are filled with data
    belonging to millions of individuals who have no knowledge of those computations. But these
    very computations, and thus their developers, almost inevitably, and without restraints,
    discriminate against these so called *data subjects*. Such practices cannot be accepted because
    these haystacks contain actual identities of human beings, including their personalities, but are
    nonetheless being recklessly monetized.
    To address this issue and reduce the possibility of discrimination, third parties have to be
    supplied with only a minimum of data. That is, data owners must be in charge of
    deciding which entity has access to what personal data of theirs.\

    This project aims to specify a personal data service that empowers its user to regain full
    control over her personal data. It facilitates the regulation of data flows and provides
    detailed information on where the data goes so that a *data subject* can become her own data
    broker. In order to trust such a service, the user must be able to look inside and see for
    herself if it behaves in unexpected ways. Therefore the specification and all implementations
    are being open sourced and developed transparently in public, which also encourages
    self-hosting.

    A quiet thought in the beginning emerged as something that felt right to do, but was still missing
    a clear outline. It took a while for both of us to understand what this work was
    about and where it would lead. Despite this, he gave me the space to write about this
    rather unconventional topic. A great thanks to my Supervisor for having all these constructive
    discussions and for not getting tired of making me rethink my thoughts.

    I challenged myself to write this thesis not in my native language. What at first might sound
    insane turned out to be a huge learning process, but I would have never be able to come this far
    on my own. Thanks to Jag, a colleague of mine, who lent me his mother tongue from time to time.
    Without him I would have not be able to reach this level of proficiency.
    \

    \

    Furthermore, I want to acknowledge all the amazing work that's been done to make the internet
    such an extraordinary common good. Thanks to everyone for contributing and sharing their
    knowledge and expertise to the rest of the world.

    Thanks to Bruno and Eugen, great minds, who I am honored to call friends, who have
    helped to review this work, making me change perspectives and rightfully forcing me to question
    my approaches.
    \

    And thanks to another great wizard who helped me fighting a widely known markup language to
    layout this document.
    \

    I'm especially thankful to the one person having my back through the whole process. Tenaciously
    but very kindly bearing the temporary downgrade. All things come to an end, thanks to you,
    Liebste.
    \

    Finally I would like to thank my parents for allowing me to get this far.
