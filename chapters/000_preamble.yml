abstract: >
    Often data is referred to as *the oil of the 21st century*. But recovering petroleum or coal is
    governed by certain rules and legislation, while vast amounts of personal data are harvested
    from all sorts of resources with no working restrictions or asking for permission. Well
    air-conditioned data centers are mining around the clock via dozens of CPUs. Eager to discover
    even the tiniest correlations worth interpreting in enormous haystacks that are filled with data
    belonging to millions of individuals, who have no knowledge of those computations. But these
    very computations, and thus their developers, almost inevitably and without restraints
    discriminate against these so called *data subjects*. Such practices cannot be accepted because
    these haystacks contain actual identities of human beings including their personalities but
    still getting recklessly monetized.
    To address this issue and reduce the possibility of discrimination, third parties have to be
    supplied only with a minimum of data, so they remain. That is, data owners must be in charge of
    deciding which entity has access to what personal data of theirs.\

    This project aims to specify a personal data service that empowers its user to regain full
    control over her personal data. It facilitates the regulation of data flows and provides
    detailed information on where the data goes so that a *data subject* can become her own data
    broker. In order to trust such a service, the user must be able to look inside and see for
    herself if it behaves in unexpected ways. Therefore the specification and all implementations
    are being open sourced and developed transparently in public, which also encourages
    self-hosting.


acknowledgement: >
    A rather quiet thought at the beginning, emerged to something that felt right to do, but was
    still missing a clear outline. It took a while, for both of us, to understand what this work is
    about and where it would lead. But regardless of that he gave me the space to write about this
    rather unconventional topic. A great thanks to my Supervisor for having all these constructive
    discussions and for not getting tiered of making me rethink my thoughts.

    I challenged myself to write this thesis not in my native language. What at first might sound
    insane turned out to be a huge learning, but I would have never be able to come this fare just
    on my own. Thanks to Jag, a college of mine, who lent me his mother tongue from time to time.
    Without him I would have not be able to reach this level of improvement/proficiency.
    \

    \

    Further more, I want to acknowledge all the amazing work that's been done to make the internet
    such an extraordinary common good. Thanks to everyone for contributing and sharing their
    knowledge and expertise to the rest of the world.

    \

    Thanks to Bruno and Eugen, great minds, to which I am honored to call them friends, who have
    helped to review this work, making me change perspectives and rightfully forcing me to question
    my approaches.
    \

    And thanks to another great wizard who helped me fighting a widely known markup language to
    layout this document.
    \

    My other/better half (significant other) for having my back through the whole time, withstanding
    the temporary downgrade of some priorities. Everything comes to an end.
    \

    Finally I would like to thank my parents for allowing me to get this fare.
