Design Discussion
==========================================



The following chapter documents the processes of a variety of design decisions, examines 
possible issues emerging alongside, and discuses different solutions obtained from several 
perspectives in order to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. Not every issue gets 
its deserved room, but major aspects will be addressed. 
In short, the majority of the project's conceptual work is done below.

The end of every subchapter includes a section containing a summary of conclusions based on the 
prior discussions related to that topic of that subchapter.
